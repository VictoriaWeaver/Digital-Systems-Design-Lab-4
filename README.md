DSDII Lab 4: Vending Machine

Design and implement a soda vending machine as a finite Moore state machine.
The coin controller is the main component implemented as a state machine.  There are four 
states: IDLE, HOLD, DROP, and ERROR.

The vending machine is the first lab to be uploaded to the FPGA (Digilent- Nexys 3, Spartan 6) 
for testing of the hardware implementation.
